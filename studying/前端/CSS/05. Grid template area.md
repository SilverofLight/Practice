Grid areas are a way to group one or more grid cells. The grid template area is an extension of this concept where you can give names to these grid areas. Once you have the names defined, you can address these new grid area items by their names and configure them accordingly.

The property grid-template-areas is usually placed inside the body tag or any container where the grid needs to be placed, the same way that you would define the rules for the grid. The main difference is, in case of grid-template-areas the values present will be the different names.

## Process

The process isnâ€™t prescriptive but these are the steps in general:

- Define the grid using display property
- Set the height and width of the grid
- Set the grid-template-areas with the appropriate name identifiers
- Add the appropriates sizes for the rows inside the grid using grid-template-rows property
- Add the appropriates sizes for the columns inside the grid using grid-template-columns property

But how exactly do you use these names and where do they come from? The names that you use inside the grid template areas are the HTML tags that you have used. Or, where you need to get more specific, you designate a class name to these tags. Once the names are assigned, you define the properties for each class the same way that you define them conventionally. Let's examine an example.

## Example

HTML:

~~~html
<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="gridta.css">
</head>

<body>
	<header> header </header>
	<nav class="nav-bar"> Navigation </nav>
	<main> Main area </main>
	<footer> Footer </footer>
</body>
~~~

CSS:

~~~css
body {
	display: grid;
	height: 200px;
	grid-template-areas: "head head"
						 "nav  main"
						 "footer footer";
	grid-template-rows: 30px 1fr 30px;
	grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr;
}
header {
	grid-area: head;
	background-color: lightsalmon;
}
.nav-bar {
	grid-area: nav;
	background-color: lightblue;
}
main {
	grid-area: main;
	background-color: lightyellow;
}
footer {
	grid-area: footer;
	background-color: firebrick;
}
~~~
